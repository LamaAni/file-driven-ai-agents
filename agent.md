# Agent Documentation

## Core Agent Behavior Logic
The core behavior of the agent is defined by its ability to process rules and lookup skills to perform tasks efficiently. This involves:
- **Rule Checking**: Evaluate conditions defined in the rules to determine applicable actions.
- **Skill Lookup**: Reference a repository of skills to identify appropriate actions based on the rules.

## Agent Loading Mechanism
The agent loading mechanism initializes the agent's components, including:
- **Configuration Loading**: Load settings and parameters from configuration files to ensure the agent operates under the defined constraints.
- **Scope Inheritance**: Parameters that are shared among agents are inherited to reduce redundancy and streamline the initialization process.

## User Selection Process
This outlines how users are selected for interaction with the agent:
- **Agent Discovery**: Identify available agents using predefined criteria and parameters that match the user’s needs.
- **Selection System**: Implement an optimized selection algorithm to determine the most suitable agent to handle the user’s request efficiently.
